# TaskOrchestrator üìä

**TaskOrchestrator** is a lightweight utility for managing concurrent tasks.
It provides flexible **Sync, Async, and Hybrid pools**, each with configurable behaviors.

---

## üå± What is a Pool?

A **Pool** is an execution ecosystem defined by:

* üîß **Configuration** (set at creation time)
* üóÇ **Prioritized Queue** (where tasks are stored and scheduled)

> üí° A **Hybrid Pool** is simply a wrapper that combines **1 Sync Pool** and **1 Async Pool**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Pool Configuration

Each pool can be customized with:

* **Fixed Workers**
  Workers always running, constantly executing tasks from the queue.

* **Elastic Workers**

  * Spawned when all fixed workers are busy
  * Automatically disposed after a configurable idle time
  * Disabled if set to `0`

* **Lifecycle Events**
  Three hooks are available:

  * `BeforeExecution<TaskInfo>?`
  * `AfterExecution<TaskInfo>?`
  * `OnFailure<TaskInfo, Exception>?`

  Each event provides a `TaskInfo` object:

  * `Id`
  * `Weight`
  * `IsAsync`
  * In case of `OnFailure`, the thrown `Exception`

## üíª Example

```csharp
var hybridPool = HybridPool.Create(
    Options.GetElasticOptions(
        2, // Workers
        5, // MaxElasticWorkers
        TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10), // 10s Idle
        (info) => Console.WriteLine($"Before Executing Task:{info.id}"), // BeforeExecution Hook
        (info) => Console.WriteLine($"After Executing Task:{info.id}"), // AfterExecution Hook
        (info, ex) => Console.WriteLine($"Task: {info.id} Just failed :( \n{ex.StackTrace}") // OnFailure Hook
    )
);

//Enqueue Sync
hybridPool.Enqueue(
    () =>
    {
        Thread.Sleep(100); // Do stuff
    }, i /*Weight*/);

//Enqueue Async
hybridPool.Enqueue(
    async () =>
    {
        await Task.Delay(100); // Do stuff
    }, i /*Weight*/);
```

### Breakdown

* üîÑ **Hybrid Pool** ‚Üí internally holds **1 Sync Pool** + **1 Async Pool**
* üßë‚Äçüíª **2 Fixed Workers** per pool ‚Üí always running
* ‚ö° **5 Elastic Workers** per pool ‚Üí created on demand, disposed after **10s idle**
* üéØ **3 Lifecycle Events** ‚Üí triggered before, after, and on failure

## üöÄ Motivation

This project started as a **small but useful experiment** in concurrency management.
It‚Äôs still in **early development**, but the goal is to build something:

* ‚úÖ Solid
* ‚úÖ User-friendly
* ‚úÖ Practical

> I‚Äôm still learning the **Task Parallel Library (TPL)** and iterating daily to improve stability, usability, and performance.

---

## Currently working on

* **NuGet Distribution**
  
* **GitHub Actions to learn how to CI/CD the package**

---

## üîÆ Future Improvements

Planned features include:

* **Task-level lifecycle configuration**
  Override global pool events for specific tasks.

* **Dynamic Task Prioritization (Aging)**
  Prevent low-priority tasks from being starved by increasing their priority over time.
